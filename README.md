# emergencyalertsystem
Emergency Alert System, also known as EAS, is this funny little project I got bored one day and created. It can mock EAS alerts, and can look more like government software. It can mock it on livestreams (though- using your OWN) it cannot do anything related to government work. Fully open-source and built by me.

Please do not use this software for harm. It was not my intention for my software to be used for the bad.
